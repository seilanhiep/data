Accuracy

The Commune Database is comprised of self-reported data from each locality and has known inconsistencies in comparison to other sources, such as the census produced by the National Institute of Statistics.

Logical Consistency

There are no known issues with logical consistency.

Completeness

ODC does not provide access to the full Commune Database since it is not already publicly available and ODC's information from the database is incomplete.

Processes

Data were provided to Open Development Cambodia directly by Save Cambodia's Wildlife's 2013 Atlas Working Group in ESRI Shapefile format. Commune-level data were combined and exported in CSV format.
