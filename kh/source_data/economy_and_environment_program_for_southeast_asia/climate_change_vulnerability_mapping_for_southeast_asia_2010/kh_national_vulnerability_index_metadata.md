Title

Climate Change Vulnerability in Cambodia (2010)

Description

This dataset provides a climate change vulnerability index value for each province in Cambodia, as determined by the Economy and Environment Program for Southeast Asia, a program administered by WorldFish. The decimal-valued index (within range [0.0,1.0]) represents the level of exposure to climate variability and change, sensitivity to cliate shocks and stresses and adaptive capacity. Data were provided to ODC in vector format by Save Cambodia's Wildlife's Atlas Working Group.
