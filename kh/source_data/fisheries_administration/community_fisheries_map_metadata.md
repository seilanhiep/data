Title

Community Fisheries Map for Cambodia (2011)

Description

This dataset provides 2011 geographic boundaries, size and the number of villages covered by each community fishery for which coordinates are available in Cambodia, as given by the Fisheries Administration. For those community fisheries sites without coordinates, locations are given as the center points of communes and metrics are taken from the Commune Database of 2011. Geographic data is encoded in the WGS 84 coordinate reference system. Data were provided to ODC in vector format by Save Cambodia's Wildlife's Atlas Working Group.

Accuracy

A number of community fisheries are missing geographic coordinates and so are represented on the map as a point at their commune's center.

Logical Consistency

There are no known issues with logical consistency.

Completeness

A number of community fisheries are missing geographic coordinates and so are represented on the map as a point at their commune's center.

Processes

Data were provided to Open Development Cambodia directly by Save Cambodia's Wildlife's 2013 Atlas Working Group in ESRI Shapefile format. The coordinate reference system was changed from WGS 84 Zone 48 N to WGS 84 and the data was exported in geoJSON format.
